    Alternatively, you can run the project using a live server like Live Server in VSCode.



## Implementation Details

 This project was created using the following technologies:

    Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the webpage.

Key Features
    Responsive Design: The webpage is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
    Custom Code: Some layout and styling are crafted using custom code rather than relying on plugins.
    Layout Matching: The recreated webpage closely aligns with the original Hexnode Kiosk Solution webpage in terms of layout and aesthetics.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, one of the significant challenges was creating a custom-made horizontal slider. After some effort and troubleshooting, the slider was implemented successfully, but there are still minor issues that need to be addressed.
These challenges were overcome through custom coding, and the slider is now fully functional within the constraints of the project. Future improvements may be needed to address some edge cases.

During development, I encountered some challenges while creating the tab contents and implementing the visual effects for them. These issues required careful adjustments to ensure the tabs functioned smoothly and matched the intended design.
